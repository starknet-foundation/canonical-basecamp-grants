# Canonical Basecamp Grants

This repository acts like a tracker for all the grants awarded via [OnlyDust](https://www.onlydust.com/) for the organization of Basecamp cohorts directly by the Starknet Foundation. All payments are tracked in the [Issues](https://github.com/starknet-foundation/canonical-basecamp-grants/issues) section of this repository.
